# CS573-Final-Project-Proposal

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project comes from three sources:  National Association of Corporate Relations Officers [NACRO](https://nacrocon.org/) membership data;  NACRO member survey data;  [College Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/) data.  The data from these sources will be merged for different parts of the project.

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a map that shows the location of institutions that members are affiliated with and the number of members at each institution.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * Who are the members at institutions near me?
 * Who are the members at institutions similar to mine in terms of size, public/private, and Carnegie Classification?
 * Who are the members in my region?
 * How do price and outcomes relate to the level of corporate engagement?
 * What is the diversity of corporate relations office types represented by NACRO members?
 * Are there geographic patterns to the level of corporate engagement?

## Sketches

The sketch below shows the relationship between the number of companies present on campus (a measure of corporate engagement) and price and outcomes.  Putting these two visualizations next to each other allows a user to select an interesting point on one of the charts and  see where that same institution is located on the other chart.

## Open Questions

While the charts that I've sketched above would be interesting, it may be challenging to implement.  It would also be interesting to let users specify the name of an institution to highlight where that institution is on the charts.  Further, there may be other institutional characteristics that may be related to the level of corporate engagement and price and outcomes that would be interesting to visualize.  Conceptualizing and presenting these multi-dimensional relationships may be challenging, but also offer opportunities to let users interact with the data.
